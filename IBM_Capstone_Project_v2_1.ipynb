        "Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario. It is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. Toronto has a large Italian Canadian community, with 32.2 percent of the ethnic Italians in Canada living in the Greater Toronto Area as of 2016. It is home to the fourth largest Italian population outside of Italy, behind SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and New York City, respectively. As of the Canada 2016 Census, there were more than 500k Italian Canadians located in the Greater Toronto Area.\n",

        "- Above the average population of 25-50-year-old professionals\n",

        "- Minimal competition around\n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective is to provide the recommendation to the prospective investor which neighbourhood of Toronto will be the best choice to start in. We will analyze data of the population and focus on the borough and explore its neighborhoods which meets the criteria above. In addition, we'll take a look at the 10 most common venues in each neighbourhood where Italian restaurants are not among the most common venue."
